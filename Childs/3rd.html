			    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JS, or JavaScript, is the most popular language for web. According to StackOverFlow, the biggest programmer learning & helping website in the world (And it’s awesome at helping people at programming problem!!!), 54.5% of back-end people is using JavaScript; 85.3% of Full-Stack developers are using JavaScript and that is far far away from second place -- SQL (Which is another great web language <del>that can cause SQL injection and make your website beem hacked.</del>) which have 58.9% user, that means that JavaScript got 20%+ users than second place! More awesomely; for the front-end, JavaScript user reach 90%, 2+ time more than second place, Angular (35.8%)! We can see that the “JavaScript is the most commonly used programming language on earth. Even Back-End developers are more likely to use it than any other language.”<sup><a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2016#technology-most-popular-technologies">[2]</sup></a>(Perheps it really is more popular than Lord Frieza...) It could be great if you learn that! JavaScript can do things such as changing the text and making <a href="https://ironpeach.github.io/My-school-works/Childs/Glossary" title="Function is a set of the code that can be repeatly used, the all you need to do is define function, than you can use it when ever you want! For example, define a function like: function = (x + 72). Than you can do things like x = 10, and do function and it will give you 82. But you can still use it after you change the value x and it will give you diffrent answers.">function</a>, combine strings, calculate value, making minigames, drawing, and many stuff, for example, you can  define a variable (You learn it in math class!) by use the var:
<hr>
&lt;script><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var x = 233<br>
&lt;/script>
<hr>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than, you got a valuable named x! You can  use it like x - 33 and you will get 200 and things like that. JavaScript can be solving problems with numbers, strings, and booleans. It can both be front-end (JQuery)and back-end (Node.JS), so it’s one of the most powerful language of web designing! It’s really good to be used! Many companies use JavaScript to make a part of their product, for example, Google, Microsoft, Uber, Facebook, twetter, and more<sup><a href="https://www.quora.com/Which-famous-software-or-companies-use-JavaScript">[3]</a></sup>So it's not only popular between devolpers, it's also popular between the companies!<del>(Oh no... This chapter is too short... Too short... Ahhhhhh!!!)</del><
