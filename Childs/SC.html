			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PHP, or the PHP: Hyper Preprocessor (I don't know what’s the point of PHP in front) is a <a href="https://ironpeach.github.io/My-school-works/Childs/Glossary" title="Back-end is the job that control function, do database, control data, etc... Basiclly means the job that you can't see. People use JS, PHP, Node.JS, and other language to control back-end.">back-end</a> language that is usually used for creating <a href="https://ironpeach.github.io/My-school-works/Childs/Glossary" title="Database means a collection of data. They record the datas, like your login information, yoru password, your gaming level, the data is saved in the database online.">database</a>, things like register, login, recording data. It’s one of the most popular server side language that is really easy to learn, but really hard to remember, so that's why many people put their PHP book aside while they code PHP(=_=). A normal PHP can be plug-in into the html, or it can be a file, its extension name will be .php or .php3, .php4 and more. A normal piece or the Hello world of PHP will look like this:
<hr>
&lt;?=echo "Hello world"
<hr>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, very ugly. In the code, echo is the same thing as display, it means that display a Hello world text on website, the reason why Hello world is in "" is because its a <a href="https://ironpeach.github.io/My-school-works/Childs/Glossary" title="A string is usually a piece of language that want to be showed that is queted by quotation mark. It usually made by bunch of letter and number.">string</a>, a string means a bunch of letter and numbers and character, it’s usually quoted(except html). But you can also just embedded your code in the html, like this:
<hr>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html><br>
&lt;html><br>
&lt;body><br><font color="00ff00">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<?php<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;echo "This is another string!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//And now, this is a comment that can include whole line.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/* This comment style can last many lines.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Like this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*And this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*/You can make this as long as you want.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?><br></font>
&lt;/body><br>
&lt;/html>
<hr>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see that the php code is embedded between the &lt;?php & ?&gt;, this is how it's embedded. The php is very powerful and easy to learn, and it get the same salary as the other language, the time like if you need money, you could learn php, and go to work, it could work. But be careful, PHP is easy to learn, but hard to master, because the basic thing can do whatever you needed, so many PHP user doesn’t have the skill that they supposed to have. This is how PHP look like, easy to learn, powerful, you could've use it wisely, but if you don’t like this, it's fine, we still got the others!
