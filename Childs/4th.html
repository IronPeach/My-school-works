			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CSS, or Ceased Style Sheet, is a 100% <a href="https://ironpeach.github.io/My-school-works/Childs/Glossary" title="Front-End is the job of font, background music, background image, picture, animation, and stuff and you see. The Language for this Job is usually by JS, JQuery, CSS, HTML, etc... ">front-end</a> language for make your page looks better. I could say all good looking website is using CSS, without CSS, the website will look very weird(Goto your gmail and while the gmail loading, click load the Basic HTML version and you can see what the website look like without CSS!). For example, the CSS can control where is the picture go. Most of the site is using CSS for the front-end because It’s really important. For example, the CSS for this website’s background is look like this:
<hr>
&lt;style>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Body{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;background-image:url("/My-school-works/Picture/Nather_Brick.png");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    }
&lt;/style>
<hr>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my website, the font you are looking at (consola), the background back there(Minecraft Nether Brick), the border there is(The gray thing surrounded) and the font size(30 pixel and 15 pixel) are all controlled by the CSS. That make CSS one of the most important thing of a website(You know, website want to be beautiful too...). So, it can be a great help when you make your website(Front-end can usually be awesome because they can hide something in the website~)! (Oh no... This is even shorter than the last one...)
