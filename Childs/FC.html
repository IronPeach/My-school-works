                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, file extension name is .html, makes up most of the website that exist in the internet. Try to do Shift + Ctrl + I, or Ctrl+Shift+J, you can see that this website is full of html. The HTML is the outline of all the programming language of website (JS, CSS, Node.JS, JQuery, PHP, etc...), because you plug those code in the HTML. The HTML is made of tags and tags, a really easy structure! A normal HTML will look like this:
<hr>
&lt;<font color="66ccff">h1></font>This is a simple text.<font color="66ccff">&lt;/h1</font>>
<hr>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see that there is things like &lt;h1>&lt;/h1>, that is a <a href="https://ironpeach.github.io/My-school-works/Childs/Glossary#Tag" title="A tag is a set of THING that comes in pairs and in &lt;&gt;. The first one in pair is called Start tag (Or Open tag). And the second tag is called End tag(Or a close tag). The Second tag is similar to start tag exept it got a / before.">tag</a>. A tag is “a marker used to create HTML elements. All elements begin with a start tag, and most end with an end tag. These tags determine what type of element is created, and the start tag include attributes for the element”(Morgan, p.303) For example, &lt;h1> is a start tag, &lt;/h1> is a end tag. Think about it like this: All the code of HTML is like a hamburger, you want to make it the way you want, so you need to use different ingredient, the code between is like the meat and lettuce and the ingredient you want... You design it! And the Tag is like the bun, it goes in front and the end of the code, just like the bun of burger goes top and bottom(Please donate me a burger! I'm so hungry!). You can add <a href="https://ironpeach.github.io/My-school-works/Childs/Glossary#Attribute" title="There is some attribute for some tags, it depend on what tag it is, for example, the tag &lt;font&gt; have the attribute "color", so it can change color.">Attribute</a> in the start tag:
<hr>
&lt;<font color="66ccff">h1 style</font> = <font color="66ccff">"color:#66ccff"</font>>This Text will have #66ccff as color&lt;<font color="66ccff">/h1</font>><br>
&lt;h2 style = "color:red">This Text will have red as color&lt;/h2>
<hr>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we can see that They got <a href="https://ironpeach.github.io/My-school-works/Childs/Glossary" title="There is some attribute for some tags, it depend on what tag it is, for example, the tag &lt;font&gt; have the attribute "color", so it can change color.">attributes</a>! The style attribute can control the style of a text, like align, color, highlight, ect... And once you start learn HTML, there is a gonna be a tons of <a href="https://ironpeach.github.io/My-school-works/Childs/Glossary" title="There is some attribute for some tags, it depend on what tag it is, for example, the tag &lt;font&gt; have the attribute "color", so it can change color.">attribute</a> and <a href="https://ironpeach.github.io/My-school-works/Childs/Glossary" title="There is some attribute for some tags, it depend on what tag it is, for example, the tag &lt;font&gt; have the attribute "color", so it can change color.">tag</a> that you need to learn, and the syntax that html require, it’s kind of hard if you are weak at logical, but it’s fine, we got a new way to write HTML!<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://ironpeach.github.io/My-school-works/Childs/Glossary#MD" title="MarkDown is a new way to write HTML, <del>to make your life easier</del>. It's made by Jhon Gruber. The target of MarkDown is make it As readable as possable.">MD</a>, or MarkDown, file extension name is .md, is used for make writing HTML easier. The creator of MarkDown, which is John Gruber, want it be “as readable as possible”<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040402182332/http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">[1]</a></sup>, so this MarkDown things comes out, it is very readable, clear, you can plug in HTML in there too. Which is awesome! This is what a normal MD file looks like:
<hr>
##<font color="FF8000">This context will be identical with the one below.</font>##<br>
&lt;<font color="66ccff">h2</font>>This content will be identical with the one above&lt;/<font color="66ccff">h2</font>>
<hr>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see, this thing is just a easy way to write html! This is a how a MarkDown work.
Now we know what a simple HTML look like, but those are casual
way to write, if you’re gonna write your code like that when you’re working, your boss is gonna fire you. You need to have a formal way to write your code. There is a structure for a HTML document:
<hr>
>&lt;!<font color="66ccff">DOCTYPE html</font>><br>
;&lt;<font color="66ccff">html</font>><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &lt;<font color="66ccff">head</font>><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<font color="66ccff">title</font>>Just plain title!&lt;<font color="66ccff">/title</font>><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/<font color="66ccff"> head</font>><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<font color="66ccff"> body</font>><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<font color="66ccff">p</font>>"&lt;p> stand for paragraph&lt;/<font color="66ccff">p</font>><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/<font color="66ccff"> body</font>><br>
&lt;/<font color="66ccff"> html</font>><br>
<font color="0000ff">&lt;!--Also, the thing in &lt;!----> is a <a href="https://ironpeach.github.io/My-school-works/Childs/Glossary" title="Comment is a thing that programmer used for reminding other programmer what this part about or tell them something, it is useless for the code, but useful for other peoples.">comment</a> of html, a comment totally useless, it's for explaining your code so others can understand.--></font>
<hr>
    Now you know the basic of HTML, goto make some simple HTML document! And now, we are going to learn some more advanced language: CSS, JS, PHP, and Git!
