                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you come in and see this website, you'll say things like "Wow, such an ugly website!"(<del>Tell me that's not true</del> It's True!) or "This website's ugliness is unbearable!" But actually, this website is made from scratch<sup><a href="https://github.com/IronPeach/My-school-works"><spam style="color:#66ccff">[1]</spam></a></sup>(I'm not a master!). It's not made via Wix or Google site or any website-making tool(It will just be ironic if I use a website making tool for how to make a website!). It's made by true programming language -- HTML, JS, CSS, Git, no PHP. Did you want to know how to make a website? You can learn about what are those language, what can they do, and some fact about it, some programmer vocabularies such as front-end and back-end. <del>Welcome to a world of geek!</del>(By the way, you can see the hyperlinked vocabulary by hover your cruser on it.)
